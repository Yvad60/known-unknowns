# Constructor functions

A constructor function is a function that creates an object using the `new` and the `this` keyword

For example

```js
function User (email, password){
  this.email = email
  this.password = password
}

const john = new User("john@gmail.com" , "12345")
const doe = new User("doe@gmail.com", "12345")
```

In the above example we have a constructor function which is used to create a user object using their email and password passed to it as arguments, this function can be used multiple times and every time it will generate a brand new object would be created.

- The convention that is used here is to declare the `User` function as Pascal case (Same as camelCase but first letter capitalized) it can even work any other way this is just a convention to simulate the way classes are created in object oriented languages

- When a constructor function is called with the new key word under the hood the engine creates an empty object and assign it to the `this` value and the statement `this.email = email` will assign email property to that empty object and the constructor function will return the value of this after executing all function code.

- One thing to note here is that arrow functions can not be used as constructor function because the constructor function highly depends on the `this` and `new` keywords and the arrow functions does not have own this value.
