# Factory functions

Factory functions are functions that create and returns object. Factory functions do not need the new keyword or this keyword since they are just functions that do one thing alone. We can think about them as the standard factory that takes in some raw materials and output a finished product out of it

```js
const human = (name) => ({
  name,
  talk: () => {
    console.log(`Hello I am ${name} and I am talking`);
  },
});

const ivad = human("Yvad");
const yves = human("Yves");
```

The function above `human` is a factory function that receives a string name as an argument and returns an object that contains the property `name` and `talk`, talk as an inner function is able to access the `name` argument (because of closures) and all of this happens without using the nasty new or this keyword.

In some case using the factory function especially when you are creating multiple object may be less performant compared to using classes or constructor functions, but unless is really many objects you are trying to create the differences are really negligeable.
